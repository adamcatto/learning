### Microscopy

Microscopy can be considered fundamentally as a class of techniques which make spatial distribution of energy at a small scale usable at a larger scale that we are interested in. Originally this meant indentifying light contrast at high resolution and magnifying the resultant image to be observed through an eyepiece, but with advances in information storage and quantitative image processing on digital computers, the de facto standard has become to store the microscopy images digitally and run an analysis quantifying properties of interest. Let's make this more concrete with some examples of important types of microscopy in biology.

An important visualization technique in molecular biology is fluorescence microscopy. Say you want to get a picture of how a protein of interest is distributed across a cell or a tissue. For instance, you may want to determine how many mitochondrial proteins are in a region of a cell biopsied from a healthy patient vs. a diabetic patient; or you may want to determine the concentration of a cell type marked by the expression of a given protein in a tissue section. A good approach would be to have some way of making that protein stand out amongst the rest of the sample's molecules when shining, say, a certain wavelength of light through the sample. This can actually be achieved by conjugating to the protein a molecule which emits light at a wavelength $W_e$ when illuminated at a wavelength $W_i$. The molecule most typically conjugated to the protein is the Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) found in jellyfish. Remarkable!

Now say instead of visualizing a snapshot of protein distribution across a cell, you want to understand the rate of diffusion of a protein across a membrane. You can still use the tools of GFP-assisted fluorescence microscopy, but now photo-bleach the membrane and some of the cytosol. Capturing a time-lapse of microscopy images now will give you a picture of the rate at which a protein moves across the membrane! This technique is called fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP).
