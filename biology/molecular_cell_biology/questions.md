# End-of-chapter Questions

## Chapter 01

1. Stanley Miller's experiments on organic molecule synthesis demonstrated the plausability of the idea that biomolecules arose through spontaneous reactions between much more primitive molecules â€“ a mixture of $CO_2$, $N_2$, $H_2$, $H_2S$, $CH_4$ $H_2$, $H_2O$, and $NH_3$, supplied with electric discharge. This led to the formation of numerous biomolecules.

2. RNA is capable of directing its own replication, acting as both an information store and a catalyst for synthesizing new RNA from existing RNA (via RNA polymerase). This is thought to be a strong contender for initial life-forms, known as "RNA-world" theory.

3. (a) Mitochondria and chloroplasts are similar to bacteria in size; (b) mitochondria and chloroplasts replicate by binary fission, similar to bacteria; (c) mitochondria and chloroplasts contain their own smaller genomes and their own ribosomes / other compartments; (d) their genomes are reproduced upon division and their intra-compartmental components are synthesized on their own ribosomes; (e) the ribosomes / ribo-RNAs are more similar to those of bacteria than to those of the eukaryotic cells in which they reside. The endosymbiotic relationship is thought to be plausible for the added reason that mitochondria/chloroplasts provide an additional metabolic option to the primarily anaerobic glycolytic eukaryotes: aerobic metabolism (mitochondria) and photsynthetic metabolism (chloroplasts).

4. Photosynthesis results in the release of $O_2$. The increased abundance of $O_2$ in the environment is thought to have given selective advantage to oxidative metabolic systems, thus supporting the notion that evolution of photosynthesis led to the selection of aerobic metabolic systems.

5. Unless I am misunderstanding the question, this is a sphere-packing problem. Using the Random Close Packing arrangement, the spherical packing efficiency is about $\epsilon = 0.64$. An approximate number of spheres to be packed is $\epsilon \times \frac{(R\cdot r)^3}{r^3}$ where $R$ is the larger sphere radius and $r$ is the radius of the spheres to be packed. Setting $R = 50\mu m$  and $r = 1\mu m$ yields an approximate 80,000 spherical *S. auereus* bacterial cells to be packed in a spherical human macrophage cell.

6. The yeast cell *Saccharomyces Cerevisiae* is the go-to model organism for studing eukaryotic DNA replication, as yeast can be easily grown in the lab, divide frequently (every ~ 2 hours), can be grown in colonies from a single cell, exhibit many common features of eukaryotic cells, and have a manageable genome size.

7. The mouse is a go-to model organism for studying mammalian embryonic development. Many mutations directing development have been identified in the mouse genome, and advances in mouse genetic engineering make studying perturbations much more tractable.

8. The theoretical limit to the resolution obtained viewing a specimen through air with a light wavelength of $0.5\mu m$ is $\frac{0.61\times 0.5\mu m}{1.0} = 0.308\mu m$, as the refractive index of air is about 1.0.

9. The microscope's magnification does not appear to be much of an issue, as other magnification techniques (e.g. projection onto a display via digital image capture) can be used to scale the image up as large as possible. However, higher resolution allows for finer structures to be imaged, so I would choose the higher-resolution microscope, i.e. the microscope with numerical aperature of 1.3.

10. Using GFP for labeling proteins of interest circumvents the need to fix and stain tissue required by antibody staining. This allows for imaging of living cells. Furthermore, one can use FRAP to observe the movement of GFP-labeled proteins; I do not believe there is any approach similar to photo-bleaching for antibody staining, or at least not one that is as easy.

11. Velocity centrifugation separates organelles that move through the sucrose gradient at similar speeds, of similar size, as organelles of similar size will move through the sucrose gradient at similar speeds. Equilibrium centrifugation separates organelles
